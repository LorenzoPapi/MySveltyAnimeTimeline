# MySveltyAnimeTimeline

A fork of the original [MyAnimeTimeline](https://github.com/TimboKZ/MyAnimeTimeline), since the original website went down.

## Main changes

- Now written in [Svelte](http://svelte.dev) because I didn't want to let ReactJS get any closer to my PC.
- Probably will have language support.

## Tools used

* [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) as the data source.
* [Svelte Gantt](https://svar.dev/svelte/gantt/) to create the timeline itself.

Available at (still haven't deployed it).
